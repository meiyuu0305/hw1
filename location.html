        <p> <h2> Find your destination </h2>
            Determining which companies you want to apply to. This process takes a lot of research and there are many factors of consideration, such as: 
            <li style="text-indent:30px; list-style-type: none;"> <u>| Work culture</u> - will this work place and how colleagues interact with each other be suitable for you</li>
            <li style="text-indent:30px; list-style-type: none;"> <u>| Self-fulfillment</u> - do you see yourself advancing and fulfill your own dreams with this company</li>
            <li style="text-indent:30px; list-style-type: none;"> <u>| Opportunities</u> - is there an opportunity for you to stay/ be promoted. Do they promote internally or hire internally</li>
        </p>
        <p> <h2> Gather paperwork</h2>
         Making a resume, gathering your transcripts, and having your Social Security Number are crucial since every application needs these. Additonally, to strengthen your application, having a recommendation letter or email from your professor/boss can help. Updating your linkedin with credentials you have earned, connect with people and be an active person overall.</p>
        <p> <h2> Stick with the process </h2>
         The application process of each company differ. However, it is very important to stay pateint and stick through with it. This is the stage that a lot of applicants will give up. Excuses such as "I will do that tomorrow", "there are too much too handle",... are <b>FORBIDDEN!</b></p>
        <p><h2> Be Persistant</h2>
         With all the companies that you have applied, there are only a slim chance of you making it in to the interview stage. Nonetheless, many doors are still wide open. Did you know, there are 33,185,550 small businesses in America alone. Therefore, do not limit yourself to big cooperations. Thus, do not blame it on luck when you have not looked hard enough yourself.</p>
